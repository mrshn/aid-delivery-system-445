# Ceng 445 Project An Aid Delivery System

## About
During a disaster, people located in various locations of a wide area need various equipments
and materials. Also there are people that can provide those equipment and materials. In this
project a social platform where demanding and providing parties meet is being developed.
Each item request will work as a workflow. The demanding user adds a request based on
a geographic location on a hypotetical map. Other users will be able to query the requests
based on geographic area and item type. When they decided to send items of the request,
they respond it and enter an estimated time of arrival. Demanders will be able to see and
choose among the responses. When delivery is agreed, providers send items. When delivery
is completed, demander marks it as complete.
The users will be able to see the state of the program on a 2D grid immitating the map.
Also users will be able to register for the requests for specific items and geographic location,
and notified whenever a new request is available.
